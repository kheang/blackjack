# Blackjack

This ruby project is a simple blackjack game that runs in the command-line interface.  The game was a weekend project after completing week 1 of The Iron Yard Academy's Ruby on Rails track in Durham, NC.

## Run

To run the game from your terminal, enter the following:

```
ruby lib/blackjack.rb
```

## Ideas for Improvement

I would love to do the following when I have some time:

* Revisit my code and refactor it
* Instead of having this run in the terminal, run in the browser and use javascript to render cards
